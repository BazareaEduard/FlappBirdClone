This is my take on a clone for the game Flappy Bird.
I tried to recreate the look and feel of the game, and while I think I did a pretty good job, the mechanics are still a little rough around the edges.
In this project I experimented with basic physics, animation and movement for games purely made in C#.
Every asset and character on the game are position manually in code, no visual component of vs was used.
This project was not made for comercial use, nor will it ever be sold by me, so any assets I used are purely destined for personal and educational purposes. I do not wish to infringe any copyright rules.
This project is meant to be seen by recruiters, so if you are one and encounter any problems with running the code, please contact me at bazareaeduard123@gmail.com and I will do my best to solve the issue.
